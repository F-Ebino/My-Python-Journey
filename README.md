# My-Python-Journey
This is a collection of the scripts, programs, files, and databases i wrote and used while learning to python from coursera.
I am documenting the journey of learning python language as my first ever experince and introduction
into the world of programming.

Most of the scripts come from assignments and examples of courses taken on the cousera platform.
They contains some scripts that solve simple problems and others that just show certain processes,
or operation that are possible using python syntax.
There are also basic data analysis scripts with a bit of sqlite.


They will not be sorted into categories based on date created, progress in my journey or complexity.
But, will be sorted into folders according to either general purpose scripts,
or those created for a specific project.

ENJOY!
